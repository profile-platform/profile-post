# Profile Post

Profile Post is a distributed, postal delivery, ledger system for verifying posts on the Profile Platform.

The ledger is responsible for keeping an immutable array of posts. Here's an example of a post...

```json
{
    "profile": "https://winegum.netlify.com/profile.json",
    "postId": 0,
    "postHash": "AB7438216DEF834FFF",
    "postTime": 12091287312389
}
```
